# Enter New Program
This program is to be used as a command in cmd prompt for creating a new program template for everyday coding. This is for lazy programmers who likes to program in good old console mode instead of IDEs ;P
Right now it generates few details like name and date/time for c++ programs.
I am planning to make it a universal new program maker but I am lazy to do that too... XD
So hands up and fork if you want to make this lazy dream come true! ;P
